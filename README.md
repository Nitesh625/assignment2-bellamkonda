## Code Fencing

 This is a collection of simple SVG shapes used as patterns. This list may grow over time but the idea is less to have a comprehensive collection than it is to have the syntax handy as a starting point for creating new and exciting patterns.


<svg width="100%" height="100%">
  
  <!-- Create mask that we'll use to define a slight gradient -->
  <mask maskUnits="userSpaceOnUse" id="fade">
    <!-- Here's that slight gradient -->
     	<linearGradient id="gradient" x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="100%">
      <stop offset="0" style="stop-color: #FFFFFF"></stop>
      <stop offset="1" style="stop-color: #000000"></stop>
    </linearGradient>
    <!-- The canvas for our mask -->
    <rect fill="url(#gradient)" width="100%" height="100%"></rect>
  </mask>
    
  <!-- Let's define the pattern -->
  <!-- The width and height should be double the circle radius we plan to use -->
  <pattern id="pattern-circles" x="0" y="0" width="40" height="40" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
    <!-- Now let's draw the circle -->
    <!-- We're going to define the `fill` in the CSS for flexible use -->
    <circle mask="url(#fade)" cx="20" cy="20" r="20"></circle>
  </pattern>
  <!-- The canvas with our applied pattern -->
  <rect x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#pattern-circles)"></rect>
  
</svg>
